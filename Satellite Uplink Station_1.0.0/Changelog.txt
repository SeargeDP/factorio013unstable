Version 0.1.1 - February 22, 2016
---------------------------------
Increased the maximum camera movement speed while uplinked.
The technology more reliably unlocks when launching a satellite into orbit.
New option in config.lua to enable more interactivity while uplinked.


Version 0.1.2 - March 1, 2016

Properly fixed the technology to use Bob's Science Pack 4 if bobtech is loaded.


Version 0.1.3 - April 10, 2016
------------------------------
You now receive ten empty blueprints when uplinked, so you can remotely direct your construction robots.
The Blueprint String mod (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=13651) will let you import your blueprints into these empty ones, and save them if you make new blueprints;
remember that blueprints you make while uplinked will be destroyed when you terminate the uplink.
Fixed Russian translation encoding issue.
Officially changed to the MIT License.
Officially changed the mod-folder name to "Satellite Uplink Sation" as opposed to just "Uplink Station".
The mod is now using the Factorio Standard Library (https://github.com/Afforess/Factorio-Stdlib/wiki).
Fixed a rare crash when the uplink station was destroyed and the player's character killed while they were uplinked.

-----------------------------
Added German translation (thanks to apcnc).
Added extra safeguards against a rare bug where the uplink-entity could be killed by enemy action.


Version 1.0.0 - July 2, 2016
----------------------------
Updated for Factorio 0.13.
The player can no longer pick up items on the ground while uplinked -- no more "Cannot insert Alien Artifact" spam!
It is now no longer possible to remove the dummy armor that is automatically given to the uplink-character, nor the equipment within.
It is now no longer possible to use the logistics system while uplinked to request items -- any items that bots do bring to you will be destroyed.
