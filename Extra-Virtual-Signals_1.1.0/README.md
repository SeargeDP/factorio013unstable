# Extra-Virtual-Signals


Adds virtual signals to a new menu tab.  They are not linked to any resource.  So use them as you wish.


Thanks goes out to DaCyclops for making the Alphabet mod that I based this off of.


To Do:
- Link to researching a tech if possible.
- Fix sorting (sp=a, ls=b-d, tr=e-g.
- Possibly change liscnce to CC-NC to allow use of CC-NC art for icons.
